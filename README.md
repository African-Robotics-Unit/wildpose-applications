## The data format of textured point cloud

There are two types of pcd files in `textured_pcds` directory.
1. `*.pcd` files contain point locations and colors.
2. `*_mask.pcd` files contain point locations and masks for lions.
For instance, points having rgb values `1` are lion `1`(the left in image) and `2` are lion `2`( the right one in image)
